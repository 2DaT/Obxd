        The numBits parameter specifies the size of key, e.g. 128, 256, 512 bit. Bigger
        sizes are more secure, but this method will take longer to execute.

        The randomSeeds parameter lets you optionally pass it a set of values with
        which to seed the random number generation, improving the security of the
        keys generated. If you supply these, make sure you provide more than 2 values,
        and the more your provide, the better the security.
